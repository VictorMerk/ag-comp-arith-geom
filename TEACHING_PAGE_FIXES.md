# Teaching Page Fixes - Quirks Mode and Favicon Issues

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Quirks Mode Issue** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Teaching pages were displaying in Quirks Mode with the error:
```
This page is in Quirks Mode. Page layout may be impacted. For Standards Mode use "<!DOCTYPE html>".
```

**Root Cause**: Malformed front matter in teaching pages. All teaching pages had an empty front matter block at the beginning:
```yaml
---
---
layout: teaching
title: Course Title
...
```

**Solution**: 
- Created and ran `scripts/fix_teaching_pages.py` to fix all 39 teaching pages
- Removed the empty front matter block that was causing Jekyll to render front matter as HTML content
- Fixed pages now have proper DOCTYPE: `<!doctype html>`

### 2. **Missing Favicon Issue** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Browser was requesting `favicon.ico` and getting 404 errors:
```
GET http://127.0.0.1:4000/favicon.ico [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 0ms]
```

**Root Cause**: 
- `favicon.svg` file was empty (1 byte)
- No `favicon.ico` file existed

**Solution**:
- Created proper `favicon.svg` with AG branding
- Created `favicon.ico` file to prevent 404 errors
- Both files are now properly accessible at `/assets/img/favicon.svg` and `/assets/img/favicon.ico`

## Verification

### ✅ DOCTYPE Verification:
