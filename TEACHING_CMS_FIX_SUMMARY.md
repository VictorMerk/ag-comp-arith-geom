# Teaching CMS Fix Summary
## AG Computational Arithmetic Geometry Website

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Archive pages showing up as "Unknown" in PagesCMS  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  

---

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

You were seeing these items in your PagesCMS "Teaching & Courses" section with "Unknown" values:

1. **"Heidelberg University Arithmetic Geometry Teaching Archive"**
   - Instructor: Unknown
   - Semester: Unknown  
   - Course Type: seminar
   - Active: False

2. **"Past Teaching at the University Duisburg-Essen"**
   - Instructor: Unknown
   - Semester: Unknown
   - Course Type: seminar  
   - Active: False

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

These are **NOT individual courses** - they are **archive/overview pages**:

### **1. Heidelberg University Arithmetic Geometry Teaching Archive**
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive archive listing ALL historical teaching activities (2010-2025)
- **Content**: 330+ lines of historical course listings organized by semester
- **Usage**: Referenced from your main teaching page (`_teaching/index.md`)
- **Type**: Archive/overview page, not a course

### **2. Past Teaching at the University Duisburg-Essen**  
- **Purpose**: Placeholder for historical teaching from a different university
- **Content**: 32 lines of placeholder text
- **Usage**: Future content for historical teaching before Heidelberg
- **Type**: Placeholder page, not a course

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

**Added exclusion rules** to the PagesCMS configuration to prevent these archive pages from appearing in the CMS:

```yaml
exclude:
  - index.md
  - documents/
  - pdfs/
  - heidelberg-teaching-archive.md    # ← Added
  - past-teaching.md                  # ← Added
```

## 🎯 **Current Teaching CMS Structure**

Your PagesCMS "Teaching & Courses" section now correctly shows:

### **Individual Courses Only:**
- ✅ **Homological Algebra Seminar** (SS2025)
- ✅ **Commutative Algebra** (WS2024/25)  
- ✅ **Modularity and Galois Representations** (WS2024/25)
- ✅ **Representation theory of finite groups** (SS2024)
- ✅ **Quadratic forms** (WS2023/24)
- ✅ **Algebra 1** (WS2023/24)
- ✅ And all other individual courses...

### **Archive Pages (Excluded from CMS):**
- 📚 **Heidelberg University Arithmetic Geometry Teaching Archive** - Still accessible on website
- 📚 **Past Teaching at the University Duisburg-Essen** - Still accessible on website

## 🔗 **How Archive Pages Are Used**

### **On Your Website:**
1. **Main Teaching Page** (`/teaching/`) - Shows current and recent courses
2. **Archive Pages** - Provide historical context and complete teaching history
3. **Individual Course Pages** - Detailed information for each course

### **In PagesCMS:**
- Only individual courses are editable
