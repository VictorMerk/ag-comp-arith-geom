Seminar on Homological Algebra (Summer Semester 2025)

Homological algebra is the study of a certain kind of algebraic invariants associated to algebraic or topological objects; it finds applications in several branches of mathematics, including algebraic topology, differential geometry, complex analysis, algebraic geometry, number theory, and commutative algebra. In this seminar, we introduce the language of (abelian) categories and focus on the simplest examples of (co)homology groups appearing in the context of abelian groups andâmore generallyâmodules over a ring R.

Please refer to the seminar program for further details.

Participants are also expected to prepare a handout for their talks. Regarding a sample format of an handout, please refer to here (or feel free to make your own format).
