  Seminar on Representation theory of finite groups (Summer semester 2024)

  Representation theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on describing elements of algebraic objects in terms of a linear transformation of vector spaces. In this seminar, we primarily focus on the representation theory of finite groups. To be more precise, we aim to study the basics of linear representations, analyzing certain examples of them such as the representations of the group of even permutations of a set of order 4 and the dihedral groups as well as to discuss fundamental results of Artin and Brauer on the subject.

  Please refer to the announcement and the seminar program for further details.

  Participants are also expected to prepare a handout for their talks. Regarding a sample format of an handout, please refer to here (or feel free to make your own format).

  Here are the notes from Vorbesprechung.

  Imported from legacy teaching listing.
