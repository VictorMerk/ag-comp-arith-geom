	<li> The language of the lectures will be English. You can hand in your solution to exercises either in English or German.


</ul><br>
</p><br>



<h3> Organizational Details: </h3>
<span class="brmedium"></span>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
	<li>In order to be admitted to the final exam of the module (Modulprüfung), successful participation in the accompanying discussion sessions (tutorials) 
	is required; This includes, in particular, to work out solutions of the weekly homework assignments. A new sheet of homework assignments will be 
	provided on MaMpf <b>every Friday around 13:00</b>. Please hand in your solutions to these by <b>11:00 a.m. on the Friday of the following week</b> via the drop 
	boxes provided in the Mathematikon, INF 205, 1st floor; Your tutor may allow other ways of handing in the solution sets. The homework assignments 
	are to be submitted in teams of two, which are formed in the first tutorial session of the semester.
	To discuss the solutions and questions about the course material, there are weekly tutorials for which you need to register via MÜSLI (see below).
	Enrollment is possible from <b>Monday, April 22, 11 a.m. until Friday, May 3</b>. The tutorials are offered at two time periods. As long as the sessions 
	are not completely filled you may change from one time period to the other. You can do this yourself in MÜSLI.</li>
	

	<span class="brmedium"></span>

	<li><u>Rules for repeaters (Wiederholer)</u>:

	If you have already acquired admission to the Algebra 2 exam in the summer semester of 2023, and if you failed the exam then, you may participate in the
	exams for the present course without acquiring the admission again. However we strongly encourage you to participate again actively in our tutorials to 
	hand in homework solutions weekly, and to enroll as a regular member of an exercise group at MÜSLI. If you do not plan to regularly hand in solution 
	sets, but would like to take part in the exam, please register in the repeaters group in MÜSLI.

<h3> Examination and grading rules:</h3>
<span class="brmedium"></span>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
    <li>In order to successfully complete the module examination (Modulprüfung), you must pass one of the two exams.</li>
  <li> <b> Admission to the exam: </b>
<ul>
        <li> Anyone who regularly takes part in the tutorials and successfully completes the homework sheets will be admitted to the exam.
		For the successful completion of the exam, it is sufficient to obtain <b>at least 50%</b> of the achievable points on the homework problems. </li>
       <li> With the exam admission you can take part in the 1st or 2nd exam for the current Algebra 2. Apart from these two exams, no other examination options are offered.  </li>
       <li> Please note: If you do not take part in one of the two exams we offer, your next chance of passing the Algebra 2 module will be in the summer
	   semester 2025.</li>
       <li> <b>Notes for repeaters:</b> Only those who took part in the exam in the Algebra 2 lecture from last year (SS 2023) and did not pass 
	   (i.e. entered a grade of 5.0 in the LSF)
		are automatically eligible to take the exam this semester without doing the exercises. In all other cases, you must take part in the
		exercise sessions as usual in order to gain admission to the exam. This means in particular the following: If the admission to the exam was acquired more than a year ago, 
		it has expired, unless the delay was not your fault (e.g. leave of absence, semester abroad, ...). 
		If the admission to the exam was acquired a year ago but without an examination attempt, it has also expired.	   </li>
</ul>
</li>
    

<li> <b>Registration for the exam:</b> Registration for the exam will be possible in MÜSLI in due time. </li>
  <li> <b> Participation in the final exam (Modulprüfung):</b> Anyone who is admitted and officially registered for the exam, but fails
  to participate will receive the grade of 5.0 unless we receive proof that the absence was not the examinees fault (e.g. illness).</li>


  <li> <b> Grading:</b> The grade for the module consists of the grade for the passed final exam, or grade 5.0 if no exam was passed.</li>
</ul><br>
