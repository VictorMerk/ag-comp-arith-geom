  curve, or an abelian variety. Another rich source are modular (or more generally
  algebraic automorphic) forms. Starting with Eichler and Shimura there was a growing
  expectation that many such representations that arise from geometry also arise from
  automorphic forms; then the representation would be called modular. A first truly
  spectacular consequence of this philosophy was Wiles proof of Fermatâ\x80\x99s Last
  Theorem (FLT), completed together with Taylor in 1995. They proved that any semistable
  elliptic curve `wasâ\x80\x99 modular. Still before Wiles, in the 1980s Serre formulated
  conjectures on absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional odd Galois representations of
  the absolute Galois group of Q with coefficients in finite fields, namely that they
  should all arise from modular forms. This would also give a proof of FLT, and these
  conjectures of Serre are now a theorem of Khare and Wintenberger from around 2007.
  The course will give an introduction to the theme of modularity of Galois representations.
  We shall review some background (with few proofs). Then we will properly state several
  conjectures/theorem on  modularity. In the later part of the course we shall learn
  some of the techniques to prove modularity results. It is certainly not expected
  that the participants know all the background. But perhaps the course is a motivation
  to take further courses in this direction, or explore research questions on once
  own.\n\nOrganizational Details:\n\nIf you are interested in participating in this

  of Darmstadt, Frankfurt and Mainz can also register in the course via MÃ¼sli but

About the Course:

Many questions in number theory can be formulated in terms of representations of the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers Q or of a general number field, typically with coefficients in a p-adic field. One source of such representations is the p-adic etale cohomology of varieties over a number field. The perhaps best known example that fits this description is the Tate module attached to an elliptic curve, or an abelian variety. Another rich source are modular (or more generally algebraic automorphic) forms. Starting with Eichler and Shimura there was a growing expectation that many such representations that arise from geometry also arise from automorphic forms; then the representation would be called modular. A first truly spectacular consequence of this philosophy was Wiles proof of Fermatâs Last Theorem (FLT), completed together with Taylor in 1995. They proved that any semistable elliptic curve `wasâ modular. Still before Wiles, in the 1980s Serre formulated conjectures on absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional odd Galois representations of the absolute Galois group of Q with coefficients in finite fields, namely that they should all arise from modular forms. This would also give a proof of FLT, and these conjectures of Serre are now a theorem of Khare and Wintenberger from around 2007.
