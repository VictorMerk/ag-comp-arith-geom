  Proseminar on Quadratic forms(WS 23/24)

  The aim of this proseminar is to formulate and study a proof of the Hasse principle for quadratic forms. All the necessary tools required such as the field of p-adic numbers, geometry of numbers etc. will be introduced during the course.

  Here's the proseminar announcement ; and here the rubric.

  Participants are also expected to prepare a handout for their talks. Regarding a sample format of an handout, please refer to a previous proseminar (or come up with your own format:-)).
