Welcome to the website of the research group "Computational Arithmetic Geometry" at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) in Heidelberg!

## About Our Research

Our group focuses on the intersection of algebraic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and computational methods. We study:

- **Galois representations** and their connections to modular forms
- **Elliptic curves** and their arithmetic properties
- **Function field arithmetic** and its applications
- **Modularity theorems** and their generalizations
- **Computational methods** in arithmetic geometry

## Key Research Areas

Our main research directions include:

- Galois representations and modular forms
- Drinfeld modular varieties and Drinfeld modular forms
- Arithmetic of function fields
- $L$-functions and Drinfeld modular forms
- Computational aspects of arithmetic geometry
