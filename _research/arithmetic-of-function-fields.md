title: Arithmetic of function fields
description: >
  We study the arithmetic of function fields, which are the function fields of curves over finite fields. This is a very active area of research that has many connections to other fields, such as coding theory, cryptography, and algebraic geometry. We are interested in the study of zeta functions, L-functions, and the distribution of primes in function fields.
