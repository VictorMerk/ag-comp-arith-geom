title: Modularity of Galois representations and the Langlands program
description: >
  The main theme of our group is the modularity of Galois representations and its applications to Diophantine equations. This is a central topic in modern number theory that connects different areas of mathematics. We are particularly interested in the study of modular forms, Galois representations, and their interplay.
