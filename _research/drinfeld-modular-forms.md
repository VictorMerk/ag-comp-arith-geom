title: Drinfeld modular varieties and Drinfeld modular forms
---
It has been observed that questions in number theory often have analogs over global function fields; then the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is replaced by rings like the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, and the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ by the field of rational functions over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of $p$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number. Because methods from algebraic geometry can be applied to function fields, many questions over the latter are more tractable than the corresponding questions over number fields. One particular instance of this is Drinfeld's proof of the **global Langlands correspondence** for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over function fields. In his proof Drinfeld introduced what are now called Drinfeld modular varieties; these are function field analogs of certain Shimura varieties. Their cohomology gives rise to Galois representations and these varieties have an interesting geometry coming from their moduli interpretation.
