title: Galois representations and modular forms

A modern way to look at algebraic number theory is to study the group $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$ of symmetries of all finite extension of the rational number $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e. of all number fields. One way of doing this is via $p$-adic (or complex) Galois representations. These are homomorphisms from $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$ to $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ for (the complex or) a $p$-adic field $K$. If one would understand all these, one could deduce many results in number theory. The reason why this approach is promising is that the **Langlands program** predicts (conjectures) that many interesting Galois representation can be found in (arithmetic) geometry, for instance by studying modular forms or elliptic curves. The most visible success of this method has been the proof of *Fermat's Last Theorem* by Wiles and Taylor-Wiles building on work of many others.
