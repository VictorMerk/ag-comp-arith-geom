- **Galois Representations**: Study of continuous representations of Galois groups
- **Arithmetic Geometry**: Geometric objects defined over number fields
- **Number Theory**: Classical and modern number theory

## Current Research

- Modularity lifting theorems
- Galois representations and their deformations
- Computational aspects of modularity
- Applications of modularity in number theory

## Education

Alireza is pursuing his PhD in Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg, focusing on modularity and Galois representations.
