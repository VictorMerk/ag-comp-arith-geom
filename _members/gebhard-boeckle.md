Prof. Dr. Gebhard Böckle is the head of the research group "Computational Arithmetic Geometry" at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) in Heidelberg. His research focuses on arithmetic geometry, modular forms, Galois representations, and computational number theory.

## Research Areas

- **Arithmetic Geometry**: Study of geometric objects defined over number fields and their arithmetic properties
- **Modular Forms**: Classical and Drinfeld modular forms, their L-functions and applications
- **Galois Representations**: Deformation theory and modularity of Galois representations
- **Computational Number Theory**: Algorithmic aspects of arithmetic geometry and number theory

## Current Projects

- Computational aspects of Drinfeld modular forms
- Deformation theory of Galois representations
- Modularity lifting theorems
- L-functions and special values

## Teaching

Prof. Böckle teaches various courses in arithmetic geometry, number theory, and related topics at the University of Heidelberg.
