Prof. Dr. Gebhard Böckle leads the computational arithmetic geometry group at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) in Heidelberg. His research focuses on Galois representations, their relations to modular forms and elliptic curves, their deformation theory, and aspects of function field arithmetic such as L-functions and Drinfeld modular forms.
