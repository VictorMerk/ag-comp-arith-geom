abstract: This is a sample abstract. We compute the depth-two part of the fundamental
  group of the thrice-punctured line in a relative pro-unipotent completion. This
  allows us to apply the Chabauty-Kim method to determine the set of S-integral points
  on this curve for certain sets S of primes.

title: Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the thrice-punctured line in depth two
year: 2019

This paper presents explicit computations for the Chabauty-Kim method applied to the thrice-punctured line. The work extends previous results in computational arithmetic geometry and provides new insights into the structure of fundamental groups in relative pro-unipotent completions.
