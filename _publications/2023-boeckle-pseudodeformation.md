## Abstract

This preprint establishes equidimensionality results for universal pseudodeformation rings in characteristic p for absolute Galois groups of p-adic fields.

## Research Context

This work extends the deformation theory of Galois representations to the setting of pseudodeformation rings in characteristic p. The study of equidimensionality properties is crucial for understanding the structure of deformation spaces and their applications to modularity lifting theorems.

## Key Contributions

1. **Equidimensionality Results**: Establishes new equidimensionality properties for universal pseudodeformation rings
2. **Characteristic p Setting**: Extends deformation theory to characteristic p Galois groups
3. **p-adic Fields**: Provides results for absolute Galois groups of p-adic fields
4. **Structural Analysis**: Advances understanding of the geometric structure of deformation spaces

## Methodology

The paper employs:
- Deformation theory techniques
- Galois representation theory
- Commutative algebra methods
- Geometric analysis of deformation rings

## Applications

This work has applications in:
- Modularity lifting theorems
- Understanding deformation spaces
- Galois representation theory
- Arithmetic geometry

## Related Publications
