  This is a sample abstract. We investigate the geometry of certain Shimura varieties attached to unitary groups of signature (n-1, 1). We prove a result on the density of CM points and relate the arithmetic intersection numbers of special cycles to derivatives of L-functions, confirming a conjecture of Kudla.
