The research of our group is in **arithmetic geometry** and **number theory**. We are particularly interested in the following topics:

- **Galois representations:** These are a central tool in modern number theory. They encode deep arithmetic information, for instance about elliptic curves or modular forms. We study their properties, in particular through their deformation theory.
- **Modular forms and automorphic forms:** These are analytic functions with a huge amount of symmetry. They are a bridge between many areas of mathematics. We are interested in their connection to Galois representations and their applications in number theory.
- **Function field arithmetic:** This is the study of arithmetic properties of function fields over finite fields. It is an area with many analogies to classical number theory, but also with its own specific challenges. We study L-functions, Drinfeld modular forms and shtukas in this context.
