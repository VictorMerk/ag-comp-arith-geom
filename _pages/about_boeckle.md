Prof. Dr. Gebhard BÃ¶ckle is the head of the research group "Computational Arithmetic Geometry" at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) in Heidelberg.

His research focuses on Galois representations, their relations to modular forms and elliptic curves, deformation theory, and aspects of function field arithmetic including L-functions and Drinfeld modular forms.
